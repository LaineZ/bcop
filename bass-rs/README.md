A patched version of Bass-rs for bc_rs

A safe wrapper around un4seen Bass

BassFX is currently not supported but its in the works!

TODO:
- Setup more tests
- Setup examples
- Setup BassFX, and maybe other plugins
- Write a better README.md
- Fix examples so they compile (note to me: norun instead of ignore)
